Super impressed with your repo, thanks for sharing! We would love to invite you to HackHands.com. Itâ€™s an Uber for developers in need... Like a real time StackOverflow. The community would love to have you, and as an expert you get paid to mentor at your convenience.  Sorry I am not contributing to your repo with this PR, just think you would make a great Ruby on Rails expert on HackHands.
